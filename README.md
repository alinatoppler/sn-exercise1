## Exercise 1

For the first exercise let's continue the mood checking program from before. Ask user to tell you what mood s/he is in:

- if the mood is "happy", the program should print out "It is great to see you happy!"
- if the mood is "nervous", respond with "Take a deep breath 3 times.". Use elif to enter more if statements: elif mood == "nervous":.
- Make up responses also for "sad", "excited" and "relaxed".
- The last option should be the normal else, which responds with "I don't recognize this mood".
